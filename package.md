# Dependency upgrade issues

## "sapper": "0.28.0"

running into major issues with sapper 0.28.1:

- [No such file "sapper/dev/build.json" â€” dev build race condition](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper/issues/1440)
- [Images are messed up with Sapper v0.28.1](https://github.com/matyunya/svelte-image/issues/67): component styling done in Image.svelte from svelte-image is stripped and doesn't appear in dev tools in Sapper v0.28.1
